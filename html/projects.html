    <!-- Summary -->
    <div style="display: grid; justify-items: center;">
      <h1> summary </h1>
      <p> some examples of my favourite personal and academic projects - see my <a style="color:lightseagreen;" href="https://github.com/elliottcoops">github</a> for everything :-)</p>
      <br>

      <!-- Group project -->
      <h1>University Group Project - My model Cars</h1>
      <p>my second year group project involved designing an interactive mobile application to enhance engagement for model car collectors
        we designed a top trumps style game where users were able to scan a collection of real life model cars and play with them in game
        being team lead meant that i was leading client meetings, orgainsing sprints and milestones using jira and presenting the final 
        project in front of a room of acadameics and industry leaders</p>
      <br>

      <h2>key development areas </h2>
      <p> <b>unity development:</b> the game was written entirely in unity and then deployed onto iphone</p>
      <p> <b>machine leaning pipeline:</b> we implmented a three stage pipeline (blur detection -> car detection -> car prediction)</p>
      <p> <b>model car collection system:</b> when a user scanned in a model car, it was added to a garage or collection to prevent having to rescan</p>
      <p> <b>uniquely designed 3d models:</b> hand crafted 3d models were designed by us in maya autodesk </p>

      <!-- Neural network from scratch -->
      <h1>MNIST-Neural-Network</h1>
      <p>An implementation of training a neural network using backpropagation from scratch</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Key development features</h2>
      <p> <b>supports any architecture:</b> the user can select any architecture, i.e. (123,2,3)</p>
      <p> <b>tested using mnist digits:</b> the network was tested using the mnist digits dataset</p>
      <p> <b>entirely in python:</b> the code is implemented entirely in python mainly using numpy for efficient matrix manipulation</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Training</h2>
      
      <p>The main training loop runs for a specified number of epochs. For each epoch, a forward pass is performed through the network to compute the weighted inputs (Z) and activations (A)
         for each layer. The loss is then computed using the mean squared error loss function for both the training and validation datasets. Following this, a backward pass is executed to calculate
          the gradients and update the weights of the network.</p>

      <p> Backpropagation involves computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the weights. These gradients are then used to adjust the weights in the opposite direction to minimize the loss.</p>
