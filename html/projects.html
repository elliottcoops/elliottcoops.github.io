    <!-- Summary -->
    <h1> summary </h1>
    <p> some examples of my favourite personal and academic projects - see my <a style="color:lightseagreen;" href="https://github.com/elliottcoops">github</a> for everything :-)</p>
    <br>

    <!-- Group project -->
    <h1>University Group Project - My model Cars</h1>
    <p>my second year group project involved designing an interactive mobile application to enhance engagement for model car collectors</p>
    <br>
    <p>we designed a top trumps style game where users were able to scan a collection of real life model cars and play with them in game</p>
    <br>
    <p>being team lead meant that i was leading client meetings, orgainsing sprints and milestones using jira and presenting the final project in front of a room of acadameics and industry leaders</p>
    <br> 

    <p>The key development areas within the project were:</p>
    <ul class = "unorderedList">
      <li class ="list"> <b>unity development:</b> the game was written entirely in unity and then deployed onto iphone</li>
      <li class ="list"> <b>machine leaning pipeline:</b> we implmented a three stage pipeline (blur detection -> car detection -> car prediction)</li>
      <li class ="list"> <b>model car collection system:</b> when a user scanned in a model car, it was added to a garage or collection to prevent having to rescan</li>
      <li class ="list"> <b>uniquely designed 3d models:</b> hand crafted 3d models were designed by us in maya autodesk</li>
    </ul>

   <!-- Neural network from scratch -->
   <h1>MNIST-Neural-Network</h1>
   <p>An implementation of training a neural network using backpropagation from scratch</p>
   <br>
   <p>The key development features of the project are:</p>
   <br>
    <ul class = "unorderedList">
      <li class ="list"> <b>supports any architecture:</b> the user can select any architecture, i.e. (123,2,3)</li>
      <li class ="list"> <b>tested using mnist digits:</b> the network was tested using the mnist digits dataset</li>
      <li class ="list"> <b>entirely in python:</b> the code is implemented entirely in python mainly using numpy for efficient matrix manipulation</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <p>Brief code explanation: </p>
    <br>
    <ul class = "unorderedList">
      <li class ="list"> <b>training loop:</b> for n epochs we perform a forward pass (compute activations), calculate loss (mse) and then a backwards pass to calculate gradients and update weights</li>
      <li class ="list"> <b>backpropagation</b> backpropagation involves computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the weights. These gradients are then used to adjust the weights in an opposite direction to minimise loss</li>
    </ul>
